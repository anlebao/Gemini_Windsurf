## 0. Maintenance Rules (Quy tắc giữ file đúng mục đích & giá trị cao)

Mọi cập nhật file này PHẢI tuân thủ:

1. **One-and-only-one:** Mỗi section chỉ tồn tại 1 lần. Cấm trùng số thứ tự, cấm trùng nội dung (Next Actions, Health Check...).
2. **No contradiction:** Một hạng mục chỉ có 1 trạng thái duy nhất (không vừa COMPLETED vừa IN PROGRESS).
3. **Ground Truth first:** Trước khi ghi path/branch/trạng thái, PHẢI verify với codebase thực tế. Cấm ghi đường dẫn/branch không tồn tại.
4. **Now over History:** Section 2-4 chỉ mô tả việc ĐANG làm và KẾ TIẾP. Việc đã xong gom gọn vào Section 10 (History Log).
5. **Actionable Next Actions:** Xóa ngay hành động đã quá hạn/sai bối cảnh. Mỗi action phải khả thi tại thời điểm hiện tại.
6. **Concise & DRY:** Mỗi fact ghi đúng 1 nơi; không copy nguyên khối log dài.
7. **Stamp every edit:** Mỗi lần sửa, cập nhật Section 11 (Last Updated + branch hiện tại).
8. **Honest Health Check (Gate 6):** Ghi đúng Assumptions/Open Questions. Assumptions >= Verified Facts HOẶC Open Questions >= 3 ⇒ khuyến nghị INVESTIGATE, cấm sửa code.

## 5. Architecture Decisions

* Decision: Use immutable `AccountingEntry` with append-only behavior.
* Reason: Accounting data must be auditable and safe for financial workflows.
* Consequences: No update/delete flow for accounting entries; corrections and reopening flows must use reversal entries.

* Decision: Use Reversal Entry pattern for period reopening or accounting correction.
* Reason: Preserves historical auditability and aligns with immutable accounting model.
* Consequences: Period closing and reopening services must generate reversing entries instead of mutating existing entries.

* Decision: Enforce multi-tenancy with `TenantId` filtering.
* Reason: Accounting data must be isolated per tenant/HKD/shop.
* Consequences: Every query/repository/service must preserve tenant isolation; tests must include tenant-isolation scenarios.

* Decision: Use `OrderConfiguration` as the single source of truth for Customer-Order EF relationship.
* Reason: The fix plan states `OrderConfiguration` defines the complete relationship and aligns better with aggregate relationship ownership.
* Consequences: Duplicate relationship configuration in `CustomerConfiguration` should remain removed; regression tests involving `Customer.Orders` must validate navigation behavior.

* Decision: Use file-based SQLite for the isolated SQLite tests recorded in the fix plan.
* Reason: The fix plan states in-memory SQLite caused reliability issues in the test constructor pattern.
* Consequences: Test cleanup must remove temporary database files; WAL-mode expectations differ from in-memory SQLite.

* Decision: Use UI Platform components for ShopERP UI work.
* Reason: Roadmap non-negotiable constraint requires VanAButton, VanACard, VanAAlert, VanAModal, VanALayout and avoids custom HTML/CSS.
* Consequences: Phase 2.6 and later UI tasks should reuse existing UI.Platform components.

* Decision: S4.0 Architecture Spike — `TenantAnnualRevenue` calculated from runtime aggregate over `AccountingEntries`.
* Reason: Avoid DB schema changes during MVP stabilization; E2E coverage priority over persistence layer changes.
* Consequences: Slightly slower calculation but accurate; deferred to `Tenant` entity only in post-MVP phase.

* Decision: S4.0 — Keep MVP transaction boundary pattern (2 API calls) instead of merging into single endpoint.
* Reason: E2E test coverage is higher priority than transaction boundary refactor; architecture debt acceptable for MVP scope.
* Consequences: `OrderCreated` domain event logged for post-MVP refactor; partial failure risk mitigated by E2E validation.

* Decision: S4 Small — Calculate `TenantAnnualRevenue` runtime via `GetRevenueByDateRangeAsync()` for Calendar Year.
* Reason: Matches TT 152/2025 "1 tỷ/năm" rule; no schema change; single-file scope keeps risk minimal.
* Consequences: Revenue calculation adds 1 DB query per checkout; acceptable for MVP volume. Method extraction deferred until 3+ consumers.

* Decision: Treat Phase 5 E-Invoice Multi-Provider Integration as production compliance blocker.
* Reason: Roadmap states core MVP is functional but production-ready HKD compliance requires E-Invoice integration.
* Consequences: Product cannot be claimed production-ready for HKD compliance until E-Invoice implementation and verification are complete.

## 6. Coding Plan

Phase 1 — Unblock CI (COMPLETED)

* Task: ✅ DONE — Added test projects to `VanAn.sln`. CI `build-verify` PASSED.

Phase 2 — Complete Sprint 2 (COMPLETED)

* Task: ✅ DONE — Sprint 2 (Period Closing Wizard + Audit Trail) merged into `main`.

Phase 3 — Sprint 3 Recovery (IN PROGRESS)

* Session 8 — Integration Test Gate Fix ✅ DONE
  * Fixed `EInvoiceDISmokeTests.cs`: Added missing `ITenantProvider` and `IVanAnDbContext` DI registrations
  * Test results: 21/21 Integration Gate tests pass (CircuitBreaker + EInvoiceDI + EInvoiceProvider)
  * Root cause: `AuditTrailService` requires `ITenantProvider`, `AccountingEntryRepository` requires `IVanAnDbContext`
  * Solution: Added `TestTenantProvider` registration and `IVanAnDbContext` forwarding to `VanAnDbContext`

* Session 8b — CS0311 Build Fix ✅ DONE
  * Error: `EInvoiceWorker` cannot be used as type parameter `THostedService` in `AddHostedService<EInvoiceWorker>()`
  * Root cause: `VanAn.Integration.Tests.csproj` missing `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` package
  * Fix: Added `<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting" />` to csproj

## 7. Known Risks

* Risk: Adding projects to `VanAn.sln` may introduce new build errors if those projects have unresolved dependencies.
* Impact: `dotnet build VanAn.sln` could fail at build step instead of test step.
* Mitigation: Verify `dotnet build VanAn.sln --configuration Release` passes locally after adding projects.

* Risk: CI runs on `ubuntu-latest` / Release configuration; local Windows / Debug may mask issues.
* Impact: A fix that passes locally may still fail on CI.
* Mitigation: Reproduce with `dotnet build --configuration Release` locally before pushing.

* Risk: Production HKD compliance depends on Phase 5 E-Invoice, which is still planned.
* Impact: Product is not production-compliance complete until E-Invoice is implemented.
* Mitigation: Keep Phase 5 visible and prioritize after Sprint 2 unblocks.

* Risk: Multi-tenant filtering mistakes can leak accounting data across tenants.
* Impact: Severe financial/data isolation issue.
* Mitigation: Require tenant-isolation tests for all repositories, services and UI-backed APIs.

* Risk: Immutable accounting constraints may be bypassed by convenience APIs or EF updates.
* Impact: Audit trail corruption and financial inconsistency.
* Mitigation: Preserve append-only design, use reversal entries for corrections.

* Risk: `LeadToCustomerConversionTests` regression check is incomplete due to a separate infrastructure issue.
* Impact: Customer-Order navigation regression partially unverified.
* Mitigation: Fix `IntegrationTestBase` relational provider configuration or add targeted SQLite regression test.

* Risk: `GetPostgreSQLMetricsAsync_Should_Perform_With_Large_Dataset` in `Core.Tests` is a flaky performance test.
* Impact: Asserts wall-clock `< 5000ms`; fails under high machine load (observed 7s during full-suite run, passes < 1ms in isolation). May cause intermittent CI failure.
* Mitigation: Separate perf tests via `[Trait("Category","Performance")]` and exclude from unit test CI step, or replace wall-clock assert with a stable metric. Technical debt — schedule as separate task after PR #6 merges.

### S4.0 Architecture Spike — Decisions Locked (2026-06-11)

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Q4: TenantAnnualRevenue source** | **Option B** — Runtime aggregate from `AccountingEntries` | No DB schema change at this phase |
| **Transaction boundary** | Keep MVP pattern: `POST /api/orders` → optional `POST /api/checkout/complete` | E2E coverage priority over architecture refactor |
| **Tech debt** | `OrderCreated` domain event for post-MVP refactor | Deferred to after E2E stabilization |

**Execution order:** S3 (DONE) → S5 (DONE) → S6 (DONE) → Stabilization → S4 (small) → Refactor post-MVP

### S4 Small — ✅ COMPLETED (2026-06-11)

**Decision:** Option A — Proceed (Calendar Year Revenue)

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Revenue Period** | ✅ Calendar Year (01/01 → 31/12) | Matches `AnnualRevenue` naming + TT 152/2025 rule (1B/year) |
| **Implementation** | ✅ Runtime via `GetRevenueByDateRangeAsync()` | Used existing API, no new method needed |
| **Data Source** | ✅ `AccountingEntries` aggregated | No Tenant.AnnualRevenue persistence |
| **Schema Change** | ✅ **NONE** | No migration, no `FiscalYearStartMonth`, no admin UI |
| **Request DTO** | ✅ Removed `TenantAnnualRevenue` | Revenue calculated backend; BusinessType preserved |
| **Files Changed** | ✅ 3 files | `CheckoutCompletionService.cs`, `CheckoutController.cs`, `CheckoutCompletionServiceTests.cs` |
| **Tests** | ✅ 5/5 PASS | All CheckoutCompletionServiceTests green |
| **Build** | ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings | Clean build |

**Implementation Details:**
```csharp
// Calendar Year revenue calculation (S4)
var currentYear = DateTime.UtcNow.Year;
var yearStart = new DateTime(currentYear, 1, 1);
var yearEnd = new DateTime(currentYear, 12, 31);
var annualRevenue = await accountingService.GetRevenueByDateRangeAsync(
    request.TenantId, yearStart, yearEnd);
```

### S7 Responsive — ✅ COMPLETED (2026-06-11)

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **TC7** | ✅ Android 360×800 | No overflow, sticky CTA clickable |
| **TC8** | ✅ iPhone 14 390×844 | No overflow, CTA visible |
| **Total Tests** | ✅ 8/8 listed | TC0–TC8 all present |
| **Test Configs** | ✅ 54 total | Multiple browser/device combinations |
| **File Changed** | ✅ 1 file | `qr-checkout-flow.spec.ts` |

**Test Pattern:**
```typescript
// TC7: Android 360×800
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 360, height: 800 });
const bodyWidth = await page.evaluate(() => document.body.scrollWidth);
expect(bodyWidth).toBeLessThanOrEqual(361); // 360 + 1px tolerance
```
